NOTE FROM ANDREW

There was a mention back in the AstralPhaser Chats that the Histacom 1.8.5 (2013) copy in indiedb is not the original copy from Phil. 
I have retrieved the original 2010 copy from Phil himself which has the original compile date of July 5th 2010. But I will be keeping both versions for the time being.
