### Epilepsy Warning
Some of the software in this pack contains a jumpscare. If you have epilepsy, please be cautious.

### Antivirus False Positives
Disable your antivirus as it may detect false positives, feel free to use a VM in case this feels not safe.

### Histacom Note
There was a mention back in the AstralPhaser Chats that the Histacom 1.8.5 (2013) copy in indiedb is not the original copy from Phil. 
I have retrieved the original 2010 copy from Phil himself which has the original compile date of July 5th 2010. But I will be keeping both versions for the time being.
